[Placeholder README file for D_BBI Project]

---

The D_BBI or Digital - Big Book of Identities (IDENTS) is a small program for holding all sorts of diffrent account, membership, subscription, profile, user information, etc etc etc (If it's connected to you specificly the D_BBI will have a way to record and save the data for safe keeping most likely.)

Program also allows for broad customization of Catagories, Identity Titles (IDENTITLES), as well as most if not all attributed Field's associated to each Identity (IDENT). This way if the program doesn't already cover the needed type or configuration of the Identity being recorded, the user can shape the IDENT and how it's saved into the local data structure or file tree as well as how its catagorized. All Fields are configurable and customizable for each IDENT being created, however Templetes (Any of which can be favorited and un-favorited by the user from the program prefrences menu) will exist to allow for more quick and easy recording of the information making up the IDENT in question. All data will be encrypted unique to each person using the program. To diffrenciate between people each will hold an account referred to as a Persona. 

Example seen below ...

>D_BBI
	>Persona
		>Catagory:("General")
			>IDENT:("Myspace")
				>Field:("Username")
					>'USER-INPUT'
				>Field:("Password")
					>'USER-INPUT'
				>Field:("Associated Email Address")
					>'USER-INPUT'
				>Field:("Associated URLs")
					>'USER-INPUT'
					>'USER-INPUT'
				...(*And so on as needed...)

Note: Fields will have catagories of their own that with a little extra work can be customized as well similar to the IDENT Catagories. All Fields will be customizable to the IDENT being created if need be. Customizing these Fields won't effect the same Fields when creating new IDENTs. However if a Templete needs to be edited or if a Field doesn't suit a Persona in any way both can be edited via the program prefrences menu.

Note: Encryption will be supported by way of a password protected Persona. Although this will ultimately be up to the user to implment or not it is highly recommended that the user take advantage of this security feature due to the sensitive information potentially contained within. Multiple diffrent encryption types and hashing meathods will be provided for the user as well.

_//:> As of 03.28.2023.5@10.00a:

-The D_BBI Project was started in mid 2023 and until otherwise stated here will continue to be updated to keep up with any stable builds developed.
 -This project is really more for my own personal private usage as I'm getting really very tired of writing all of this out on sheets of paper and cataloging them in a binder. Not to mention the security problems such a tactic creates...
-Most of what has been discribed above and throughout this document as of the date refrenced above this list is but design on paper alone unfourtantely. It has been layed out though and now the education to convert the brainstorming and work done on paper and other documentation into code making up a program with all features intact can take place.
-Fair warning to any that may have stumbled upon this project for whatever reason; it is likely not to be even close to usable for quite some time. I will however update the above information as well as continue to record any Ramble On's pertainate to the project. So if you do find this interesting, well firstly ~you is awesome thanks~ lol - but more importantly secondly feel free to check back here for any updates to the project.
-Any questions, thoughts, or inquiry one may like to put forth concerning the D_BBI Project can be emailed to "RightRat.D_BBI@mail.com" and I'll endevor to respond as soon as I am able to. Thanks!~
